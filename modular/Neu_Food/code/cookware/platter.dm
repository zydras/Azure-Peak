NEW SYSTEM
What it does:
	- The platter stays intact, adds object on top of it. 
	- Examining the platter tells you what is on the platter
	- Adds food overlay to the platre
	- Can remove item with right click
	- Using it will eat the food on it
	- Use initial[name] to revert platter back to being its original name once the food is removed
