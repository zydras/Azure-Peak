		<div>
		<p><b>NAVIGATOR:</b> The heart of commerce of Azuria. This ancient machine lifts goods up by balloons to ships at the dock and the ATC's warehouse. The mechanisms are a trade secret of
		Azurian Trading Company. There's three variants: Public Navigator, Navigator and Smuggler's Navigator</p>

		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Drop sellable items on the eight tiles surrounding the machine. A balloon arrives every two minutes and lifts them into the air.</li>
			<li>Anchored items, coins, handcarts, ATC-sealed items, and items flagged unmintable (items that spawned in town at mapstart) are skipped.</li>
			<li>Each item's payout is its base price multiplied by category demand (current ship demand boost), then reduced by the navigator's handler fees - including export duty, merchant's levy,
			and any handler fees imposed by say, smugglers.</li>
			<li>Items priced below 1m of net payout are refused outright with a "the market is choked" message.</li>
			<li>Clicking on the Navigator reveals the current state of the warehouses.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Public Navigator</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>By default, it pays Crown's export duty AND the merchant's levy. The levy is also taxed at the same export duty rates to prevent tax base shrinking because of the Merchant's cut.</li>
			<li>Seller net drops on the navigator's tile; the Merchant's levy share and taxes remits directly to the factional fund.</li>
			<li>Merchants and Shophands can right-click and toggle two switches: Crown duty PAYING/DODGING and Merchant's levy COLLECTING/WAIVED. Dodged duty accrues to STATS_TAXES_EVADED and is shown in the panel.</li>
			<li>Per machine tallies (duty collected, duty evaded, levy collected) are visible to Merchant/Shophand only.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Private Navigator</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Same as the Public Navigator, except the Merchant's levy is waived by default.</li>
			<li>Generally located in a more discreet location for the Merchant or Shophand to dodge export duty without easy exposure.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Smuggler Navigator (battered)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Pays no Crown duty and collects no Merchant levy. It uses the Black Market saturation pools. Demand is static. Saturation regenerates passively.</li>
			<li>Handler fee defaults to 50%. If a bathhouse worker is within 7 tiles when the lifting fires, the fee drops to 0% for that cycle.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Tax Collection</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Crown duty remits to Crown's Purse, with a portion given unto the Church for the Concordat tithe if it is in force.</li>
			<li>Merchant's levy remits to the Merchant's Fund, held in a secure Jawbank.</li>
		</ul>

		<div>
		<p><b>SHIP FULFILLMENT CRATE:</b> A crate used to fill the bulk demands of docked foreign vessels. The crate pays out at the per-line price the docked ship is offering, less Crown export duty and the Merchant's middleman cut.</p>

		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You need a MEISTER account. The crate refuses goods from anyone without one.</li>
			<li><b>Left-click with an item:</b> deposit that one item.</li>
			<li><b>Right-click the crate:</b> dump everything on your tile into it at once.</li>
			<li>Handcarts and bins on your tile are unpacked automatically - the crate matches their contents one item at a time.</li>
			<li>Each accepted item is matched against an open demand line on a docked ship and you are paid into your account directly.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What the crate accepts</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Bulk goods:</b> Tradeable raw or finished goods (cloth, ore, smelted ingots, leather, cured fish, and so on) matched to open bulk demand lines.</li>
			<li><b>Victualling - Fresh:</b> Readied meals matching the docked ship's victualling dish list.</li>
			<li><b>Victualling - Preserved:</b> hardtack, salted stores, dried provisions. Also capped per line.</li>
			<li><b>Victualling - Drinks:</b> sealed brewer bottles only. Uncorked or partially-drunk bottles are refused.</li>
			<li>Bundles (raw stack items like fibers and hides) are accepted up to the remaining demand on the line, any leftover stays in your bundle.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What the crate refuses</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>ATC-sealed items (anything bought from Goldface or Silverface, or otherwise spawned with the Company seal).</li>
			<li>Rotten food.</li>
			<li>Items priced below the demand line's offered price are still accepted - the ship pays the line price, not the item base price.</li>
			<li>Goods not on any docked vessel's open manifest.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How it relates to the Navigator</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Navigator is the right tool for anything you want to sell at the prevailing market rate - it'll take anything sellable.</li>
			<li>The Fulfillment Crate is the right tool for goods the docked ships specifically want, paid at the ship's offered (usually better) price.</li>
			<li>Favor toward docked vessels accrues on bulk and victualling fulfillment alike. The Merchant's reputation depends on sellers showing up at the crate.</li>

		<div>
		<p><b>GOLDFACE & SILVERFACE:</b> GOLDFACE is meant for the Merchant's own use, whereas Silverface is the public facing versions, split by rows and offering goods at a very high markup.</p>

		<h3>GOLDFACE</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Locked/Unlocked by the merchant key or skeleton.</li>
			<li>Coin must be manually loaded and then used to buy goods</li>
			<li>ATC members can flip the Secrets toggle to enable the no tax upgrade, avoiding import tariffs</li>
			<li>Total tax paid and evaded are tracked per machine, and visible only to ATC members.</li>
			<li>Bought items are spawned ATC-sealed and cannot be re-exported via the navigator or the bulk fulfillment crate.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The Harbor tab (GOLDFACE only)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>GOLDFACE is the command center for foreign trade. The Harbor tab shows docked ships, the wider ship pool, and discovered realms.</li>
			<li><b>Hails:</b> Merchant/Shophand, or anyone bearing the Merchant's Writ of Charter, may spend hails (one per ship invited to port) up to [TRADE_SHIPS_HAIL_PER_DAY] per day. First hail of the week from a given realm reveals that realm's market info. Grenzelhoft, Otava and Aavnr starts with their market conditions discovered.</li>
			<li><b>Dock spots:</b> 2, upgradable to 3. Vessels can be sent away after a [TRADE_SHIP_SEND_AWAY_GRACE / 600]-minute grace period.</li>
			<li><b>Cultural stocks:</b> Docked ships carry cultural-goods packs at a [TRADE_CULTURAL_SHIP_DISCOUNT_PERCENT]% discount off base cost. Import tariff still applies unless dodged.</li>
			<li><b>Bulk buy:</b> Docked ships offer bulk cargoes for sale, in small quantities but enough to help supplement market shortage or local shortfall.</li>
			<li><b>Bulk demands:</b> Docked ships purchase a large amount of goods at a decent markup, generally more than the town can produce reasonably.</li>
			<li><b>Victualling demands:</b> Docked ships demands delicious readied meals and preserved foods at a significant markup, providing an opportunity for profit for the Merchant and Innkeeper,
			Soilson or Cooks that can fulfill these orders.</li>
			<li><b>Merchant's levy:</b> Merchant/Shophand can set the levy percentage (0 to [TRADE_MERCHANT_LEVY_CAP_PERCENT]%). This is the same levy collected by the Navigator on producer exports.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>SILVERFACE (public)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Cannot be locked. keys are refused on the public variants. Adds a flat [50]% extra_fee Guild surcharge on every pack on top of base cost and import tariff. Designed to be unprofitable relative to Goldface.</li>
			<li>It was previously lockable, but producer can compete on price as is original intent - with at least a 65 - 90% markup over actual producer and simplification of the order workflow, plus players bad faith locking or locking and then AFKing without doing the job, the locking function has been removed.</li>

/datum/book_entry/treasury_merchant/harbor_mechanics/inner_book_html(mob/user)
	return {"
		<div>
		<p><b>HARBOR MECHANICS:</b> The Merchant hails ship, manage sell and purchases from them, accumulate flavor and send them off.</p>

		<h3>Hailing</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You have [TRADE_SHIPS_HAIL_PER_DAY] hails per day. A hail brings one ship from the pool to dock.</li>
			<li>The first hail from a given realm reveals that realm's market conditions for the week. Grenzelhoft, Otava and Aavnr start revealed.</li>
			<li>If a ship is sent away Honored, the spent hail is refunded - so a Merchant with stock to back it up can chain hails.</li>
			<li>A ship's tonnage determines its expected favor target and the amount of goods it can carry. It scales non-linearly from 100t to 800t.</li>
			<li>Docked ships can be sent away after [TRADE_SHIP_SEND_AWAY_GRACE / 600] minutes, or immediately if Honored.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Demand multipliers</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Each realm wants specific categories. A docked ship raises demand on those categories - the Navigator pays above base for goods in them.</li>
			<li>Capped at 1.5x payout. Two ships wanting the same category stack toward the cap, not past it.</li>
			<li>Demand evaporates when the ship leaves. A category paying 1.5x while a ship is in port pays 1.0x once it's gone.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Saturation</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Each category has a mammon denominated warehouse pool. Goods sold through the Navigator fill the pool. Capacity is rerolled at roundstart and pop-scaled with each player giving 0.5% additional capacity.</li>
			<li>A ship docking for a category drains 50% of that category's saturation, opening room for more sales while it's in port.</li>
			<li>A full warehouse refuses further intake. The Navigator sends the goods back with a \"market is choked\" message.</li>
			<li>The Black Market runs in parallel. Half capacity, flat prices (no demand mechanic), but regenerates 25% saturation per day automatically.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Send Off outcomes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Every ship docks with an expected favor target scaled by tonnage. Small coaster = small target, large galleon = large target.</li>
			<li><b>HONORED</b> (>=100% of target): Full delivered value banked as Favor, hail refunded.</li>
			<li><b>PARTIAL</b> (>=50%): Half delivered value banked as Favor. No hail refund.</li>
			<li><b>DISHONORED</b> (<50%): Flat Favor penalty, scaled by tonnage.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What the Merchant has to decide</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Two hails a day, many ships in the pool. You can't hail them all - pick the ones you can actually fulfill.</li>
			<li>Balance between making a profit by arbitrage from their supplies, cultural stocks in demand by mercenaries and LARPer, and what the town produces.</li>
			<li>Small ships are easily Honored - low target, low reward, hail comes back. Large ships brings more goods with bigger Favor payout but it is much harder to hit the target alone.</li>
			<li>Hailing a ship you can't supply costs you both the hail and the Favor (Dishonor penalty). Better to leave them in the pool.</li>
			<li>Producers can fill the bulk demand crates. Your Favor income depends on whether they show up.</li>

	name = "05. The Kinship Bonus"

/datum/book_entry/treasury_merchant/kinship/inner_book_html(mob/user)
	return {"
		<div>
		<p><b>KINSHIP BONUS:</b> A modifier tied to the active Merchant's chosen origin. While a Merchant from a foreign realm sits the role, ships of that realm show up more often, buy higher, and sell lower.</p>

		<h3>What it does</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>-[round((1 - KINSHIP_BUY_MULT) * 100)]% on buys</b> from kin ships - bulk cargo at Goldface and cultural-stock packs both pay [round((1 - KINSHIP_BUY_MULT) * 100)]% less.</li>
			<li><b>+[round((KINSHIP_SELL_MULT - 1) * 100)]% on sells</b> when fulfilling kin realm ships' bulk demands at the Ship Fulfillment Crate, before Crown duty and Merchant's levy.</li>
			<li><b>Guaranteed daily ship</b> - one of the day's [TRADE_SHIPS_PER_DAY_ROLL] ship rolls is reserved for a kin realm vessel. The remaining rolls use the normal weighted draw. If the Merchant latejoins after the daily roll, the kin slot is backfilled immediately by swapping a random undocked ship in the available pool for a kin one (docked ships are never touched).</li>
			<li>The bonus is <b>global</b> - any producer fulfilling a kin ship's demand gets the +[round((KINSHIP_SELL_MULT - 1) * 100)]%, not just the Merchant. The Navigator's flat exports are not affected.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How it gets set</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The bonus follows the active Merchant's character origin (Lirvan, Gronnic, Otavan, etc.). Azurian and Elsewhere Merchants confer no Kinship.</li>
			<li>It <b>persists</b> through Merchant death or FT until a new Merchant of a different realm takes the role. If no Merchant has joined yet this round, there is no Kinship.</li>
			<li>A Merchant of the same realm replacing the previous one does not flip the bonus.</li>
			<li>When a new kin realm is claimed mid-round, the available ship pool is checked - if no kin ship is already waiting, one is swapped in immediately so the Merchant has a kin vessel to hail without waiting for tomorrow's roll.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Shophand and Agent variant</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A <b>Shophand</b> or holder of the Azurian Trading Company's Writ of Charter gets a personal <b>-[round((1 - KINSHIP_BUY_MULT) * 100)]% on Goldface buys</b> from ships of <b>their own</b> origin.</li>
			<li>This does <b>not stack</b> with the global Kinship. If the global Kinship already covers the same ship, the agent's personal discount does not add - the buy is -[round((1 - KINSHIP_BUY_MULT) * 100)]%, never -[round((1 - (KINSHIP_BUY_MULT * KINSHIP_BUY_MULT)) * 100)]%.</li>
			<li>It only fires on Goldface purchase actions; the Shophand doesn't extend the +[round((KINSHIP_SELL_MULT - 1) * 100)]% sell side.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Chartered Agent access at the Goldface</h3>
		<p>A character bearing the Writ of Charter from the Merchant is recognised by the Goldface itself, even if their day job is something else (Mercenary, Adventurer, etc).</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Cultural Stock tab</b> - the agent may browse and buy cultural-stock packs from any docked vessel. Their personal kinship discount (if any) applies the same way it would for the Shophand.</li>
			<li><b>Harbor tab</b> - the agent may view the docked ships, the wider ship pool, market conditions, and may <b>hail</b> ships and <b>send them away</b> on the Factor's behalf. Bulk supply purchases are also open to them.</li>
			<li><b>Locked out</b> - the agent cannot touch the Market, Management, or Ledger tabs. Levy rate, gnome margin, gnome unlock, pier rental, auto-hailer, and the fund log remain Merchant/Shophand only.</li>
			<li>Hails count against the Merchant's daily allotment regardless of who spent them. The Merchant trusts the agent at their own risk - the Writ of Charter is revocable.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Where it shows</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Goldface examine names the current Kinship realm.</li>
			<li>Goldface's Harbor tab marks kin ships with a "Kin" badge.</li>
			<li>Fulfillment crate examine flags kin payouts.</li>
			<li>The Navigator does not show it - Kinship is a ship-side bonus, not a balloon-side bonus.</li>
