// Merchant Potions. Merchant potions are meant to be relatively cost ineffective and set a CEILING for potion prices
// Normal potion brewer can and should undercut these prices. However this gives merchants more things to sell to fulfill their role as "adventurer shop"
// And hopefully generate demands for potions from other brewer who can offer it cheaper while improving access
// Yes, they are meant to have access to the high tier stat buff potion but not the second tier health or mana potions or any of the poison.
