//VAMPIRE SERVANT CLASSES//
// These classes are high in skills/traits to give them potental to be good drivers for roleplay gimmics under the vlord. Such as making a feast, where the town shows up and finds themselves the feast suddenly.
//Or perhaps hosting tournies where the victors get turned into vampyric champions hand-picked by the vlord. Or perhaps as a smithing operation where people mysteriously disappear delivering materials but then show up fighting in good  gear later.

//The general shtick behind these classes is that they are absolute statbeasts for crafting, or utility. In the case of servantry, a lot of skills usually pretty useless to antagonists when it comes to large-scale fighting, like farming.
//Or music despite not getting bard mechanics (which is intentional), they're also able to make disguises.

//In the case of the forgemaster, they're basically your weapon and armor producer, that labors away in the manor or wherever you setup, they've a good deal of mining skill to get started wherever you pick to setup your dastardly lair.
//These classes go with pretty low-end stat weighting, they're not meant to be spammed as frontline fighters. I mean you can do it anyway but expect them to die. They do not come with armor.

//I expect the hyperwar vlord to have 1-3 and the gimmic one with anywhere of 2-6 of these. They're pretty much lich sapper skele skilline in mind. They've a little bit of extra utility but nothing great unless you invest into it.
//They also have medium amounts of mammon to work with, so they can try to spin or run their own thing if you set them loose. Or to buy things for your/their shtick in town.
