		//						//

//Intended to be very, very powerful keep-equiv characters. They're sort of minibosses that cost the vlord a lot to deploy but absolutely pull their own weight.
//Vlord will be trading off between these guys, power levels and their servant swarm, compared to freshly sired classes, these are intended to be stronger than the MAA/Knight in town.

//All of these classes should have riding, they should be above 10 in statline at minimal unless they have some insanely overpowered gimmic that requires them to be otherwise.
//Remember that job caps currently until this is false, do not get respected by vampires picking them as loadouts so do try to avoid making something excessively strong, they should be a feared foe but not the main antagonist.

//They aren't supposed to be too common, feel free to jakk up the prices in bloodpool.ddm in neu vampires if they are too common. Worst case they somehow still are, I might see to trying to limit them.
//Due to their more, richer status they don't meddle with a mix of gilbranze, they use steel of the century. Vlord gets a full enchanted set but these guys just get steel, plain and simple.



//The fragbeast class, powerful, jack-of-all-trades. Similar to knight banneret or knight with town buff.
//Pretty insane when you look at it, but you need to remember unlike wretches, these guys absolutely WILL dust upon dying due to being bloodpool vampires. +5000 vitae cost.

//Pretty much very good at everything fighting related; gets pretty stupidly strong once vlord upgrades to full power. But at that point you've bigger issues than 2 of these guys.

//Spy class, has very good agility, ability to slip around, listening, lockpicking and melee talents. Formidable and best played by sly players, they've a lot of tools at their hand, including the same amount of wealth as a vlord to work with.
//On top of decent-ish staying power in combat skill, a very good statline. They're supposed to be quite powerful in roleplay-created authority and able to pull strings in town and cause problems independantly to the vlord, under their command.

//Played right this class could probably cause more damage than the vampire lord themselves without even being close to their statline, traits and whatever else, this is completely fine and honestly if it happens. Good for them, you get to impersonate a style of either a foreign noble, a suitor or a foreign royal.
//TLDR: specialises in sabotage via roleplay hooks, power, coin and tools but it also inherently has decent traits to stand their own ground or even bring the fight themselves through martal and ranged arts combined. On top of T3 vamp magics from their generation.
