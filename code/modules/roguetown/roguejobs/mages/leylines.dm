/*
 * ========== Leylines ==========
 *
 * Leylines are the sites where mages perform encounter rituals. Scattered across the world
 * in different regions, each aligned to a realm. Mages must travel to find them.
 *
 * Charge system (veil attunement): each mage has dayspassed + 1 charges, minus charges spent.
 * Each ritual costs 1 charge. This naturally gates early-week spam while
 * rewarding patience — by day 4-5 you can chain several rituals in one trip.
 * Since charges are limited, mages are expected to go out to realm-aligned leylines
 * rather than waste charges on tamed ones that always give fewer mobs.
 *
 * Day gating: T1 - T3 always available, T4 from day 3, T5 (Void Dragon) from day 4.
 * This keeps the first few days focused on lower-tier encounters.
 *
 * Leyline types:
 *   Tamed (hamlet/tower) — 4 uses/day, T1 only, neutral alignment.
 *     Neutral = not aligned with anything, so rituals always get -1 mob (training wheels).
 *   Normal (coast/grove/decap) — 2 uses/day, up to T4. Realm-aligned.
 *     Matching ritual alignment = full mob count. Wrong alignment = -1 mob.
 *   Powerful (bog) — 2 uses/day, up to T5. Void-aligned. Always +1 primary mob.
 *     Wrong alignment in Bog nets to normal — the +1 and -1 cancel out.
 *     Only leyline type that supports the T5 Void Dragon ritual (uses a T4 circle).
