The Inquisition is hereby granted the right to try foreigners, those sanctioned and outlawed by the Duchy for crimes of high heresy, or those who are handed over by order of Crown and Court. The Holy Inquisition is to be granted permission to aid in trials of citizenry alongside the lawful authorities of the land, save for the Nobility, who must be tried before the Crown.

In exchange, as foreign adherents sanctioned by treaty, the Inquisition shall bear no tax nor levy, neither upon their persons nor upon the instruments of their office; nor shall the Crown hinder their holy duty, save by lawful cause shown before the Bishop or Council.

Yeven under the seal of the Crown, in witness of Psydon and the Ten."}
